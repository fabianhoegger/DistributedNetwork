# Distributed Network
Distributed Network Simulation using omnet++

##  Purpose
 The purpose of the project was to show the difference in how the packets travelled from node to node depending on the change of the numbers of neighbours.
 Using a flooding algorithm in randomly generated nodes we elected a "leader" node based on which was the one with most neighbours and we tracked the traffic through each node.
 Each time we changed the distance were a node should be connected with another, a metric we a called rc.
 That we show that ,as you see below the less neighbours there the more traffic there is in the nodes closest to the "leader" node
